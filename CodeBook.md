## The explaination of column "activity" and "subject"
**activity:** The activity of a person when the specific measurement was taken. &nbsp
Including six kinds of activities:"WALKING","WALKING_UPSTAIRS","WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS","SITTING","STANDING","LAYING". &nbsp
**suject:**  The subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. &nbsp
